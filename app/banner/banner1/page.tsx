          IT Services & Digital Engineering: Accelerating Enterprise Transformation
        </h1>

        <h2 className="py-4 w-full text-2xl font-semibold">The Digital Engineering Services Revolution</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Global enterprises face an existential imperative: transform digitally or face irrelevance. The engineering
          services market is projected to grow from $2.34 trillion in 2025 to $4.65 trillion by 2032. Digital product
          engineering alone is expanding from $216 billion to $354 billion by 2028 at 10.4% annually.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          This growth is driven by the universal shift toward software-defined products, cloud-native infrastructure,
          and data-driven decision-making. Organizations across industries are reimagining offerings through digital
          transformation. Achieving this requires specialized engineering talent—capabilities Keptel delivers.
