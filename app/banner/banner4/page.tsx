          Industrial Automation: Transforming Manufacturing Through Smart Technologies
        </h1>

        <h2 className="py-4 w-full text-2xl font-semibold">
          The Explosive Growth of Industrial Automation
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          The industrial automation market is entering a period of extraordinary expansion. Valued at approximately
          $47 billion in 2025, it is projected to reach $91 billion by 2035—driven by Industry 4.0 adoption, AI-powered
          autonomous systems, digital twin technology, and 5G-enabled machine communication. With a CAGR above 10%,
          automation has become essential infrastructure for global manufacturers.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Automation is no longer a cost-driven modernization choice. It is the backbone of competitiveness in a
          digital-first industrial landscape. Organizations that fail to automate risk falling behind faster, smarter,
          and more efficient global competitors.

          to intelligent systems while enabling workers to focus on high-value responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          In Q1 2025 alone, North American manufacturers ordered more than 9,000 industrial robots worth $581 million.
          Automotive companies led a 42% surge in unit volume as they tackled labor shortages and advanced production
          efficiency.
        </p>

        <h3>AI and Predictive Intelligence</h3>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Roughly 63% of organizations plan to adopt AI within three years. Machine learning turns automation into a
          dynamic, adaptive capability. Predictive intelligence anticipates equipment failures, optimizes maintenance,
          and boosts operational efficiency. Siemens reports over 30% efficiency gains through Industry 4.0 adoption.
        </p>

        <h3>Edge Computing and Real-Time Processing</h3>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Edge-based industrial architectures enable microsecond-level decision-making directly on the production line.
          Real-time processing allows systems to respond instantly to changing conditions, ensuring safety and quality
          in high-speed manufacturing environments.
